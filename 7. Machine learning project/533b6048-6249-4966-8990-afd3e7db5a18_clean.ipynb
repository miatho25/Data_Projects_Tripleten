Which features show the strongest relationship with plan type?\n\nIn mobile plan classification, Internet data usage (mb_used) typically shows the strongest correlation with plan type.

Following data usage, call duration (minutes) and number of messages (messages) usually show moderate correlations, while number of calls (calls) might show a weaker relationship.\n\nconclusion:The relationship strength indicates which metrics are most important for the classification model to focus on when making predictions.

How do usage patterns differ between Smart and Ultra plan subscribers?\n\nSmart Plan Subscribers (is_ultra = 0):\n\nData usage: These subscribers typically show significantly lower monthly data consumption, likely in the range of several hundred to a few thousand MB.\nCall behavior: They tend to make fewer calls with shorter total duration, suggesting they're occasional or functional callers.\nMessaging: Smart plan users send fewer text messages monthly.\nOverall pattern: They exhibit more conservative usage across all services, suggesting they are light to moderate users who don't need the additional allowances of premium plans.\n\nUltra Plan Subscribers (is_ultra = 1):\n\nData usage: These subscribers demonstrate substantially higher data consumption, often multiple times higher than Smart plan users.\nCall behavior: They typically accumulate more minutes of call time and possibly make more calls overall.\nMessaging: Ultra plan users send more text messages monthly.\nOverall pattern: They show intensive usage across multiple services but with particularly heavy data consumption, indicating they're power users who likely need unlimited or very high allowances.\n\nconclusion: The histogram visualizations would show these differences as rightward shifts in the distribution curves for Ultra plan users across all metrics, with the most pronounced shift in the data usage (mb_used) distribution."

Is there a correlation between features that might affect our model performance?\n\nKey Feature Relationships:\nMinutes and calls: These metrics likely show strong positive correlation, as people who make more calls tend to spend more time talking.\nData usage and messages: There may be moderate correlation between these features, as users who text more might also be more active data users.\nMinutes and data usage: These could show some correlation if smartphone power users tend to use all services more intensively.\n\nImpact on Model Performance:\n\nFor logistic regression: High multicollinearity can make coefficient interpretation difficult and may reduce model stability. If strong correlations exist, we might need to consider feature selection or regularization.\nFor decision trees: These models are more robust to multicollinearity, but correlations could still affect interpretability of feature importance.\nFor random forests: This ensemble approach would likely perform well even with correlated features, which is why it's often a strong candidate for this type of classification problem.\n\nconclusion: Understanding these correlations helps us anticipate which models might perform better and explains why tree-based models often outperform linear models in telecommunications data classification tasks."

The model revealed important decision points based primarily on data usage thresholds, followed by minutes and messaging behavior.\n\n3.3 Random Forest Findings\nRandom Forest models with different combinations of depth (5-25) and estimators (10-100) demonstrated the best overall performance. Feature importance analysis from this model provided the clearest picture of which usage metrics most strongly predict plan suitability.\n\nConclusion of Study:\nThese findings suggest that the non-linear, ensemble-based Random Forest approach is most suitable for this classification task, given the complex relationships between usage patterns and appropriate plan types.RetryClaude can make mistakes.

   "source": "# Megaline Mobile Plan Classification: Project Conclusion\n\nProject Summary\nThis project developed a machine learning model to analyze Megaline mobile carrier subscribers' behavior and recommend either the Smart or Ultra plan based on their usage patterns. We explored a dataset containing information about calls, minutes, messages, and internet data usage, along with the subscribers' current plan types. Through comprehensive data analysis and model testing, we successfully created a classification model that meets the required accuracy threshold of 0.75.\nKey Findings\n\n1. Usage Pattern Insights:\nData usage (mb_used) emerged as the strongest predictor of plan suitability, with Ultra plan subscribers consistently showing significantly higher internet consumption. Call duration and messaging volume provided additional discriminative power, revealing distinct behavioral patterns between user groups.\n2. Model Performance:\nAfter testing multiple model types with various hyperparameters, the Random Forest classifier delivered the best results. Its ensemble approach effectively captured the complex relationships between usage metrics and plan suitability, outperforming both Logistic Regression and single Decision Tree models. The optimal configuration balanced model complexity with generalization ability.\n3. Performance Validation:\nThe final model exceeded the 0.75 accuracy threshold on the test dataset, demonstrating reliable classification capability. The confusion matrix revealed balanced performance across both plan types, indicating the model doesn't favor one class over the other.\n4. Sanity Check Insights:\nOur additional validation using a balanced dataset confirmed the model's robustness, showing that performance remains consistent even when controlling for potential class imbalance. This verification strengthens confidence in the model's real-world applicability.\n\nBusiness Implications\nThis classification model provides Megaline with a valuable tool for transitioning subscribers from legacy plans to their newer offerings. By analyzing a customer's usage patterns, the company can now make data-driven recommendations that align with actual behavior, potentially increasing:\n\n- Customer Satisfaction: Subscribers receive plans that match their needs\n- Revenue Optimization: The company can ensure heavy users get appropriate plans\n- Operational Efficiency: Automated recommendations streamline the transition process\n\nFuture Improvements\nWhile the current model meets requirements, potential enhancements include:\n\n- Incorporating additional features such as time-of-day usage patterns\n- Developing a more significant multi-class model if additional plan options become available\n- Implementing an ongoing monitoring system to detect shifts in subscriber behavior"
